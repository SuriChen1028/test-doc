    "# 9 A richer economic setting\n",
    "\n",
    "While our main analysis has so far focused on a stylized model of the coupled climate-economy dynamics, our framework is also well-suited for exploring richer environments. Important modeling extensions include  additional macroeconomic components that allow for adaptation, technological change, and multiple sectors. We have left off the table discussions of technological innovation that could support the transition  from dirty to clean capital and the reallocating  production from technologies that are vulnerable to climate change to ones that are more  resilient.  Modeling extensions that allow us to address a broader range of economic responses are  important both for assessing the role of policy and for  accommodating  market responses. \n",
    "Rather than constructing an all purpose integrated assessment model,  we describe a two-capital model setup that allows us to confront some of the gaps left with our illustrative model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We take as starting point the two capital, AK specification of \\cite{EberlyWang:2012} that includes  adjustment costs and hence sluggish reallocation.  The resulting technologies are stochastic subject to Brownian increment shocks and are used to output that is divided between investment and consumption.  It is a two capital extension of the undamaged consumption/investment model that we have used so far.   Although their model has stochastic growth, many parameter configurations imply long-term stationary behavior of the relative capital stocks. The ratio of the capital stock becomes a featured state variable \n",
    "for their model.  \n",
    "We start with two capital stocks that evolve as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "d K_{j,t} =  K_{j,t}   \\left[ \\mu_{j,k} (Z_t) \\cdot dt + \\left({\\frac {I_{j,t}}{K_{j,t}}} \\right)dt - {\\frac { \\kappa_j} 2} \\left( {\\frac {I_{j,t}} {K_{j,t}}} \\right)^2 dt\n",
    "+ \\sigma_{j,k}(Z_t) \\cdot dW_t^k \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $K_{j,t}$ and $I_{j,t}$ are technology  specific capital and investment for $i=1,2$.  The output of each  production is proportional:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{j,t} + C_{j,t} = \\alpha_j K_{j,t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first application, the planner has an instantaneous utility function that can  be represented as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log \\left[ \\left( C_{1,t}\\right)^{1-\\eta} \\left( {\\mathcal E}_{1,t} \\right)^\\eta  + \\left( C_{2,t}\\right)^{1-\\eta} \\left( {\\mathcal E}_{2,t} \\right)^\\eta\\right] \n",
    " - (1 -\\eta) \\log N_t \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the two sources of emissions contribute to damages differentially.  Here, we have in mind coal and oil where coal use generates more emissions, and therefore leads to more climate damages than oil.  \n",
    "In the absence of climate change considerations, both technologies are attractive sources of production.  Taking account of climate change, a planner will shift production to the cleaner of the two technologies.  This model opens the door to considering uncertainty and policy as it pertains to taxing or restraining coal production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we change the configuration to consider clean versus dirty technologies.  To do so, we drop emissions from the second technology and replace it by an input available in fixed supply, $\\tau$.  The resulting  instantaneous utility function is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log \\left[ \\left( C_{1,t}\\right)^{1-\\eta} \\left( {\\mathcal E}_{1,t} \\right)^\\eta  +  \\left( C_{2,t}\\right)^{1-\\eta} \\tau^\\eta\\right] \n",
    " - (1 -\\eta) \\log N_t \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We suppose initially that there is a productivity advantage for the dirty technology, but that there is a third investment opportunity   devoted to research and development (R\\&D) that can induce improvements in the production from the green sector. The outcome of accumulated R\\&D investment is the eventual stochastic arrival of a more productive green technology where the arrival is modeled  as a jump process with intensity linked to the current stock of R\\&D.   This setting is reminiscent of the framework explored by \\cite{Acemogluetal:2016}, though their focus is on the dynamics of innovation abstracting from capital reallocation and   concerns about uncertainty. This second application opens the door to studying potential subsidies for R\\&D in the face of broadly conceived uncertainty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As a third application, we suppose that  one of the two production   technologies  is vulnerable to climate change while the other one is not. \n",
    "Consumption and investment from the two technologies are treated as perfect substitutes. We add an additional source of damages that might be triggered in the future but for only the first technology.  Thus, the first technology is more vulnerable to climate change, as there is a productivity decline with an uncertain arrival time that becomes more likely as temperature increases.  Given the sluggishness in reallocating capital, there can be non-trivial transitional consequences to this drop in productivity. This setting allows us to explore the role of policy for monitoring or limiting this vulnerability in the presence of damage  uncertainties. See \\cite{Fantetal:2020} and \\cite{Klingetal:2021} for recent research quantifying vulnerability of productive activities to climate change and the potential need for adaptation. In a different vein, valuable quantitative research has been done building probabilistic models of  climate tipping points and assessing their risk consequences.  See, for instance, \\cite{Lentonetal:2008} and \\cite{Caietal:2015}. A model such as the one we described opens the door to the study of heterogeneous vulnerability to tipping point uncertainty conceived of more broadly than is typical in risk analyses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While other studies have explored policy challenges introduced by related models, we will study the broad consequences of uncertainty in such environments. In each case, we can include the analogous  uncertainty concerns through model misspecification and ambiguity as before. By enriching the dynamics, however, we also open the door to new channels  by which uncertainty comes into play and to alternative policy levers worthy of exploration.  "
